# **Description**
The sample data was collected using PocketSDR (L6E) and Septentrio Mosaic-X5 (multi-GNSS, multi-frequency). 

They were collected in June, 1, 2024. However, the data size was too large to upload on GitHub. Therefore, I uploaded the data on my Google cloud. If the data link doesn't work, please send an email to me. Thanks.
