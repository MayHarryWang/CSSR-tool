# **Description**
The sample data was collected using PocketSDR (L6E) and Septentrio Mosaic-X5 (multi-GNSS, multi-frequency). 

* PocketSDR data: pocket_trk_L1L6_0601.log
* Output log data: sbf_B2bE6BL6E_0601.log
* Septentrio data: sept0601.sbf

They were collected in June, 1, 2024. However, the data size was too large to upload on GitHub. Therefore, I uploaded the data on my Google cloud. If the data link doesn't work, please send an email to me. Thanks.
